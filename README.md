# nucleolus_segmentation

This project uses the fast.ai library to train a model that can segment DAPI+transmitted light images of cells into nucleoli.  

Images of transmitted light, DAPI and nucleophosmin were taken with the imageXpress micro confocal high-content screening microscope.  

The ground-truth nucleoli masks were created by the 'make_masks.ipynb' script using the nucleophosmin images.
